## Web API Code Challenge Quiz
# The Repository
This Code Repository("Web API Code Challenge Quiz) was started with the idea to create a quick JavaScript quiz. It includes the functionality of a start page, that will start the quiz and also take you to the highscores. Once you hit the start button it will start the quiz and the timer will start counting down from 20 seconds to zero. If a question is answered incorrect 2 seconds will be removed from the timer. When the timer has reached zero, the quiz will end. 

During this challenge a new HTML , CSS and Javascript was created. Coding Principles such as Web API Dom was utilized during this challenge. 

I ran into some troubles during this challenge which included running into some issues with my timer and localStorage. LocalStorage during the issues would reset my Interval ID, after an extensive debuggin I was able to overcome my issues and the interval ID would not reset. I fixed my timer issue as well, at this point the timer is functioning as it should.
